					<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, it is not until something fails us and we need an electrician, that we realize how dependent we are on electricity. In our daily lives, and for so many different activities, we need and use electricity extensively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class=" wp-image-34 alignleft" src="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Electricians-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="334" srcset="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Electricians-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Electricians-2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" />Certified Electricians Are Almost As Trained As Doctors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the highly dangerous field of electrical work, there is no room for mistakes. Electricians who have become <a href="https://www.electricpilot.com/">certified electricians</a> have been preparing through classwork and practical experience for many years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There Are Several Areas Of Specialty</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Electricians might also specialize in residential, commercial, industrial, or outdoor power lines, but again, many electricians can work in more than one of these areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electricians Are Safety Professionals Too</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Part of the electrician&#8217;s job is to perform safety checks. Electrical hazards are very real, and that is why there are many safety standards that electricians must be well versed with. Since electricians work in a variety of locations and different types of buildings, they must follow proper and correct building codes when they are installing electrical models.  You can typically put your trust in an <a href="https://proampelectric.ca">expert residential electrician</a> like the ones in Coquitlam, BC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electricians Require A Wide Range Of Skills</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While electricians require a wide range of skills, they must be particularly good at:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Examine and interpret plans</li>
<li>Plan and carry out projects</li>
<li>Using tools</li>
<li>Logical thinking</li>
<li>Working with your hands, with excellent hand-eye coordination</li>
<li>Customer service</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Electricians also need to be good at handling stress, as they often work in strenuous situations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electricians Need Proper Clothing And Tools<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-33 alignright" src="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Electricians-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="387" srcset="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Electricians-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Electricians.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In light of the demanding, dangerous and specialized work of electricians, they must wear the correct safety clothing while on the job. Heat shrink tubing is very useful for electrically insulating a cable, especially before a weld or splice. Their use is very simple: just insert the electric cable inside the sheath, then with the help of a NOT direct heat source (a lighter, a heat gun or a soldering iron) gently heat the sheath, paying close attention. not to touch it with the open flame. Thanks to the heat the sheath will shrink around the electric cable, sealing it electrically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is anticipated that many more jobs will be available for electricians in the coming years because this occupation is critical to home and property construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work performed by electricians is specialized and requires particular skills, experience and tools. While we are so dependent on electricity for many of our needs and activities, there will be a constant need for qualified and competent electricians.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-64 alignright" src="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-68173-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-68173-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-68173-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-68173-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-68173-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-68173-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Do you feel like you&#8217;re circling around in your bowl like a goldfish? Do not remain an electrician; change!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical problems:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time, this is an unwanted reason, since we are dealing here with problems linked to the disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are not diseases that require heavy treatment since in this case, it is not a question of retraining but of being treated. No, I am talking about handicapping physical problems for the electrician profession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two examples:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The herniated disc which can be very annoying (I speak knowingly).</li>
<li>An allergy. I have already met a person who had to change their activity after having developed a strong allergy to glass wool (with quite serious reactions).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are only examples, but they echo the change in a professional career in a forced way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hernia, a problem that can lead you to change jobs and consider another job after an electrician</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fed up with electricity:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s what made me change my profession at the time: fed up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was not so much from a technical point of view, but rather hierarchical and technocratic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I can understand that as an electrician, you can also get fed up and want to change your professional path.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The impression of being a sheep:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a point that will appeal to independent craftsmen (electricians).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I put electrician in brackets because I think it is applicable to all professions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There may one day be a moment when you feel oppressed by the French tax and administrative system. I have known several electricians, who after having achieved good results with a company of several employees, said stop to change the professional path.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you think you are a sheep or a sheep and you are thinking of stopping your activity as an electrician?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Work after an electrician, ideas for reconversions in the world of electricity:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not sick of electricity, here are some ideas for retraining in trades where your knowledge will be particularly useful.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-61 alignleft" src="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Teacher in education:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you mean vacation every 6 weeks?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I stop right away, because I know from experience that this will trigger virulent comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More seriously, your professional career in electricity may be of interest to the professional sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are an educator and patient, it is possible retraining.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Electricity teacher, a good way to pass on your knowledge</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Private trainer:</strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Adult training:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not only the education of young people but also people retraining in adults.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many training centres recruit trainers. Once again, pedagogy is necessary.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Professional training:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If as an electrician, you have developed a specific skill, you can provide it as a professional in a private training organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Examples?</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Riser installer.</li>
<li>Fibre optic welder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technician for electrical diagnostics:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will need to pass certification (in some cases with a pre-requisite for a diploma).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working in electrical diagnostics, a good way to change jobs</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Commercial in electrical equipment:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, if you have a bit of flair and want to keep your footing on construction sites and <a href="https://www.electricpilot.com/electrical-connection-pellet-stove-and-fireplace-standard-and-advice/">rub shoulders with electricians</a> all day long, you can opt for the trade of electrical equipment suppliers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your knowledge of the trade and the equipment will be a real plus.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conversions that have nothing to do with the electricity trades:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should not think that because you have worked in a very specific field like electricity, you will not be able to get out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite the contrary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More and more entrepreneurs are interested in profiles that do not correspond to the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why? Because there are new things to bring with a different experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, this will not be done in large companies, which prefer to “stay in the matrix” and find the exact profile (and sometimes the 5-legged sheep).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion, what to do after an electrician?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you want to change jobs and leave the electricity works?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With what I told you in this article, you already have a few possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to your CV and belief in yourself: this is what will help you to go to the end and change your profession.</p>

Do not remain an electrician; change!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical problems:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time, this is an unwanted reason, since we are dealing here with problems linked to the disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are not diseases that require heavy treatment since in this case, it is not a question of retraining but of being treated. No, I am talking about handicapping physical problems for the electrician profession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two examples:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The herniated disc which can be very annoying (I speak knowingly).</li>
<li>An allergy. I have already met a person who had to change their activity after having developed a strong allergy to glass wool (with quite serious reactions).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are only examples, but they echo the change in a professional career in a forced way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hernia, a problem that can lead you to change jobs and consider another job after an electrician</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fed up with electricity:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s what made me change my profession at the time: fed up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was not so much from a technical point of view, but rather hierarchical and technocratic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I can understand that as an electrician, you can also get fed up and want to change your professional path.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The impression of being a sheep:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a point that will appeal to independent craftsmen (electricians).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I put electrician in brackets because I think it is applicable to all professions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There may one day be a moment when you feel oppressed by the French tax and administrative system. I have known several electricians, who after having achieved good results with a company of several employees, said stop to change the professional path.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you think you are a sheep or a sheep and you are thinking of stopping your activity as an electrician?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Work after an electrician, ideas for reconversions in the world of electricity:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not sick of electricity, here are some ideas for retraining in trades where your knowledge will be particularly useful.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-61 alignleft" src="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.electricpilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-pixabay-355904-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Teacher in education:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you mean vacation every 6 weeks?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I stop right away, because I know from experience that this will trigger virulent comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More seriously, your professional career in electricity may be of interest to the professional sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are an educator and patient, it is possible retraining.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Electricity teacher, a good way to pass on your knowledge</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Private trainer:</strong></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Adult training:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not only the education of young people but also people retraining in adults.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many training centres recruit trainers. Once again, pedagogy is necessary.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Professional training:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If as an electrician, you have developed a specific skill, you can provide it as a professional in a private training organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Examples?</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Riser installer.</li>
<li>Fibre optic welder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technician for electrical diagnostics:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will need to pass certification (in some cases with a pre-requisite for a diploma).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working in electrical diagnostics, a good way to change jobs</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Commercial in electrical equipment:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, if you have a bit of flair and want to keep your footing on construction sites and <a href="https://www.electricpilot.com/electrical-connection-pellet-stove-and-fireplace-standard-and-advice/">rub shoulders with electricians</a> all day long, you can opt for the trade of electrical equipment suppliers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your knowledge of the trade and the equipment will be a real plus.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conversions that have nothing to do with the electricity trades:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should not think that because you have worked in a very specific field like electricity, you will not be able to get out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite the contrary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More and more entrepreneurs are interested in profiles that do not correspond to the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why? Because there are new things to bring with a different experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, this will not be done in large companies, which prefer to “stay in the matrix” and find the exact profile (and sometimes the 5-legged sheep).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion, what to do after an electrician?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you want to change jobs and leave the electricity works?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With what I told you in this article, you already have a few possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to your CV and belief in yourself: this is what will help you to go to the end and change your profession.</p>
